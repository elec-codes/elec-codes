👋 Hi, I’m @elec-codes

-👀 I’m interested in many things of different kind: ML, AI, robotics, quantum physics, space exploration & science/techonology in general. 

-🎛️I know programming languages such as Python, but also ladder and SCL for PLCs, in particular, I know how to use the TIA Portal software with S7-1200 and Ecostruxture Machine Expert with M221.
